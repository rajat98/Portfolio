                        Hey there! I'm <span className="purple">Rajat Pawar</span>, a master code craftsman with a 4.00
                        GPA at Arizona State University.
                        I'm not just surfing the academic wavesâ€”I'm conquering them. Whether it's unraveling the
                        mysteries of distributed systems or mastering the intricacies of cloud computing, I'm the go-to
                        geek with a penchant for perfection.
                        <br/> <br/>
                        In the dynamic realm of software engineering, I've honed my craft in crafting dynamic
                        dashboards, migrating systems, and optimizing performance. Venturing into <span
                        className="purple">cloud computing</span>, I've
                        architected solutions on <span className="purple">AWS</span>, ensuring scalability and
                        reliability. Moreover, my expertise spans
                        <span className="purple"> distributed systems</span>, where I've orchestrated intricate
                        communication and data consistency using
                        technologies like <span className="purple">Kafka</span>, gRPC etc. Whether designing distributed
                        banking systems with <span className="purple">gRPC</span> or constructing
                        <span className="purple"> ELT</span> data pipelines with <span
                        className="purple">Kafka Connect</span>, I thrive on pushing the limits of what's possible in
                        software engineering and data engineering, leveraging languages like <span
                        className="purple">Java</span>, <span className="purple">Python</span>, <span
                        className="purple">Ruby</span>, and
                        <span className="purple"> JavaScript</span> to bring
                        ideas to life.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
